# Spring Certification Training

This repository is a multi-module application built for my *Spring Certification Training* online course.

This application built using Spring 5 MVC and all the CRUD operations performed on the Entity.

At UI side I have used JSP to display the list of users and other operations like Edit/Update/Delete.
